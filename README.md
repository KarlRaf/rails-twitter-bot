We want to built a twitter bot who can reply. Also he will tweet on an every day basis something based on newspaper headlines or a book... Ultimately, the goal is to create a bot clever enough to be consider as real human, with smart interactions (fav, reply and retweet). Bonus: It will be cool, to automatize the process of kinda creating clever bot for non dev ppl with a web app.

Feel free to help especially if you have knowledge in machine learning.
